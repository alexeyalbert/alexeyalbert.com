- Developed on-board camera system to record high quality redundant video during launch and parachute deployment in a heavily power- and performance-constrained environment.
- Was solely responsible for parachute selection, involving CAD modeling and CFD simulations of various parachute sizes and shapes to select one that would slow the CANSAT down to the precise speed required by the mission parameters
- Solely designed and built QHA ground station antenna and worked with team members to optimize the design using Ansys HFSS simulations.
- Secured a software license sponsorship equivalent to $50,000 in value
- Designed subteam mission patch
