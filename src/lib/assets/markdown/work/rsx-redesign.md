Over the summer, I appointed myself the role of Redesign Lead and completely overhauled the design and brand identity for UofT's Robotics for Space Exploration design team.

This involved creating:

- A new set of logos
- A comprehensive style guide for current and future marketing members to reference, compiling all the logos, colours, typography, as well as examples and best practices
- A complete "starting from nothing" rebuild of the [website](https://rsx.skule.ca), done in Svelte, and deployed on Cloudflare Pages

## Logo

The logo was by far the most challenging and time consuming portion of the redesign. While I landed on a decision regarding the fonts and layout of the lockup fairly early on in the process, I was still working on the icon into August.

In recent years, RSX has started to expand in scope. Instead of simply being a Mars rover design team, composed of the mechanical, electrical, software, science, and arm subteams, we also house RSX Aerial, which competes in the [CANSAT Competition](https://cansatcompetition.com/index.html) and I'm the Jr Lead of, as well as a drone team, which is developing a drone for the rover's mission, and a drone for the Aerial team's drop testing.

My challenge was creating a logo that incorporated the themes of robotics and space, representing the whole of the team, without leaning too hard into the Mars rover imagery, or over-representing space exploration and under-representing robotics.

This was especially a problem in my early iterations, where I focused on the rover wheel or lone space imagery. I think the logo I landed on strikes a good balance and accurately represents RSX, while leaving room for the team to grow or evolve over time.

## Brand Guide

The [brand guide](/pdfs/RSX%20Brand%20Style%20Guide.pdf) serves to compile the core of the new brand identity into a single document that future marketing members will be able to reference, ensuring that a consistent through-line is maintained in our visual identity, and that even unexperienced members can contribute content for our social channels and stay on theme.

The following is taken directly from the Branding Style Guide:

> RSX’s visual language is meant to be one that reflects the broader spirit of its best members. The shapes are razor- sharp. The colours are bright, punchy, and energetic. The type is bold and often in all-caps, looking as though it could support its own weight. The language of this new design isn’t afraid to be in-your-face. It’s unabashedly itself.

### Images

I also wanted the images we use to match this theme and follow in the same philosophy. In order to try different image effects and experiment with how I could edit images to feel cohesive within the team's visual identity, I developed a small web app, [dithertool](/dithertool).

I experimented with using a Bayer matrix dither effect, however this caused a moiré effect at certain scales and was incredibly lossy when considering the actual content of the images. I also tried many other dithering algorithms and combinations of colours, scales, effects, etc. I wasn't very satisfied with any of them.

Instead, I ended up landing on a tined grain effect. This preserves detail and the information/content of the image very well, yet allows for extremely customizable styling that perfectly compliments the team's visual identity.

## Website

The website was the largest implementation of the brand identity and was the proving ground for the broader redesign.

I used Svelte due to its commitment to performance and simplicity, which will likely be easier to maintain for future marketing teams than if I used something like react, while still providing some much-appreciated conveniences that make development much easier.

The website itself is just a static site deployed on Cloudflare Pages using the Svelte `adapter-cloudflare` adapter. I initially wanted to—and did—use Workers since it seems like Pages is on its way out, but Workers doesn't support custom subdomains outside Cloudflare zones, which is crucial to be able to use our [rsx.skule.ca](https://rsx.skule.ca) subdomain.
